# For loops
# Simple for loop

# for fruit in fruit_list:  # for and in are keywords. You can use any word instead of fruit as long as you use the same word inside the for loop to refer to the item in the list.
#     print("I like ", fruit)
# For Loop within a For loop
vegetable_list = ["broccoli", "carrot", "celery"]
groceries = [fruit_list, vegetable_list]
# for list in groceries:
#     for item in list:
#         print("I like ", item)
#print(groceries[1][:2]) #to access specific item 
# for list in groceries: #to access specific items
#     print(list[:2])
# For loop using range function
# for y in range(3):  # range(3) starts at 0 and goes to 2 in steps of 1 (0,1,2)
#     print("You should buy: ", fruit_list[y])
# Break in For loop
# for vegetable in vegetable_list:
#     print(vegetable)
#     if (vegetable == "carrot"):
#         break

# While loops
# x = 0
# while x < 6:
#   print(x)

# Functions
#Function with no parameters that doesn't return data
# def message_printing(): #This line defines the function. Notice no parameter is defined, so no data is supposed to be passed into the function
#     print("Hi there!")
# for _ in range (3): #in this case, we don't care about the value of _ That's why we name the variable as an underscore. That's the convention in Python whenever you have a variable whose value you don't care about
#     message_printing() #This line calls the function.

# Function with parameters that returns data
